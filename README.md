# BStill
This app has been made in few hours during the Startup Weekend Lausanne 2018 (https://startupweekend.org/)
It has been designed to support B-still product, a physical long-term stress analyzer, performing labo analysis on user's samples. 
The app will allow uses to visualize their stress-test result and to store the historical data in their associated account.
Other features offered are:
- plot data in a graph chart
- personalized advice.

This is intended to be a prototype. The physical test machine prototype was not realized during these long 54 hours.
